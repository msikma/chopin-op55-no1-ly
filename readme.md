Nocturne Op.55 No.1 in F Minor (F.Chopin)
-----------------------------------------

A transcription of Chopin's 15th Nocturne in Lilypond using the original
manuscript as primary source.

Not entirely complete yet.

Notes
-----

* Transcribed using the manuscript as the primary source.
* Slurs that connect to tied notes always end on the first note
  and start on the last note (for visual consistency).
* Some acciaccaturas have slurs added to the note they connect to.
* MIDI output probably isn't accurate. I didn't test for it.
* Bar 19: the manuscript only has eighths here, not a dotted 8
  followed by 16 as in many scores.
* Bar 27 and 43: following the manuscript, and since there's no
  ambiguity, these triplets have their numbers hidden.
* Bar 48 and 57: we only show the triplet numbers once and then hide
  them, as per the manuscript and for clarity.
* Bar 56: the manuscript indicates `<bf d g>8.` `<bf d af'>16` `<bf d bf'>4`
  here, and not a `<bf d af'>4` at the end like in many scores.
* Bar 72: contrary to many scores, the manuscript indicates no fermata
  on the `g4.`, and no tie combining the `c16` with the next bar's `c4`.
* Bar 73: manuscript indicates *"tempo primo"*, which is changed to
  *"a tempo"* since it means the same and is the more common notation.
